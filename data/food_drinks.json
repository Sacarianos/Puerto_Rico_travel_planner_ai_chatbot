In 2022 we opened our doors to the public as the first dessert and cocktail bar in Puerto Rico. This is the perfect atmosphere where you can find desserts, cocktails, wine, and coffee. We also offer charcuterie boards and some savory tapas. One of the most fantastic things about our concept is we can suggest a drink like our Cornetto martini, which is our twist on an espresso martini. The cornetto pairs well with our cheesecake bonbon or a charcuterie board.",

Today, Apa is the owner and protagonist when it comes to preparing a good roasted pig. The quality of his products is so high that he has visited restaurants such as Bernardine in New York, participated in the Food and Wine Fest in Aspen Colorado and traveled with the tourism company to promote our culture and the flavors of this land. Apa is distinguished by being simple, humble, but above all proud of his work.",
